# Viper

## Why Viper exists

Viper is a fast, album-centric native music player for Linux with a low memory footprint. It is designed to browse and play music from local folders or Samba shares, including libraries served by Navidrome.

## Security

If you save Samba credentials, Viper stores the password in its local SQLite database at `~/.config/viper/viper.sqlite3`. Anyone who can read that file may be able to retrieve the credentials.

## Requirements

- Rust and Cargo

## Run

```sh
cargo run --release
```

The app opens to the Home view. To select or change the music folder, choose **Library → Choose Music Folder**. The selected folder is saved and scanned automatically on later launches. Scan progress appears beside the current page title.

## Features

- Browse the Home and Albums views, search the album library, and open album track lists.
- Play an album or start from a selected track; use previous, play/pause, next, stop, seek, and volume controls.
- Navigate with the File, Library, Playback, and View menu dropdowns.
- Choose **Set Home/Albums as startup view** from the corresponding sidebar item's context menu.
- Album metadata falls back to filenames and folders when tags are missing. Albums are grouped by album artist when available, while track artists remain visible.
- Disc folders such as `CD1`, `Disc 2`, and `Disk 3` use the parent folder as the album name and artwork location.
- Load cover art from neighboring image files or embedded audio artwork; artwork is reduced to a 320 px thumbnail and cached.
- Read audio metadata and embedded artwork with Lofty and Symphonia.

Preferences let you choose your music folder and startup page. Preferences and album state are stored in SQLite at `~/.config/viper/viper.sqlite3`. Existing settings databases are copied from the previous `~/.config/viper/` location on first launch.

## Build an AppImage

Build a distributable AppImage for x86_64 Linux:

```sh
./packaging/build-appimage.sh
```

The output is written to `target/appimage/`. The first run downloads linuxdeploy into
`~/.cache/viper/appimage-tools/`; subsequent runs reuse it. Build on the oldest Linux
distribution you intend to support for the best compatibility with older systems.

## Install on Arch Linux

From a checkout of this repository, install Viper with:

```sh
./packaging/install-arch.sh
```

The script builds the release binary and installs Viper under `/usr/bin` with its
application menu entry and icon. Cargo and the native build/runtime dependencies must
already be installed. It uses `sudo` when needed; you can also run it as root.

To remove the installed application files later, run:

```sh
./packaging/uninstall-arch.sh
```

## Samba / SMB libraries

On Linux, open **Preferences → Connections → Samba / SMB share** and enter a share URL such as
`smb://nas.local/Music/Albums`. Username, password, and workgroup are optional for guest
shares; entered connection settings are saved in Viper's local SQLite database. Viper uses Pavão and the
system `libsmbclient` library. Install `libsmbclient-dev` to build and `libsmbclient` to run
the application (for Debian or Ubuntu, `sudo apt install libsmbclient-dev libsmbclient`).
SMB1-only servers require insecure legacy protocol support and are not enabled by default.

## Project layout

- `src/main.rs` starts the application; `src/app/initialization.rs` configures fonts and the native window, then creates `ViperApp`.
- `src/app/` coordinates application state and initial library loading in `library_loader.rs` and filesystem updates in `library_watcher.rs`.
- `src/views/home.rs` and `src/views/album_grid.rs` render the Home and Albums pages; album details and track rows live under `src/components/`.
- `src/library/` owns models, `sorting`, `scanner`, `modifications`, audio-file helpers, tag reading, metadata caching, and folder watching.
- `src/artwork/` scans for and prepares cover art in `scanner.rs`, and manages decoded artwork textures in `cache.rs`.
- `src/playback/player.rs` handles Rodio playback with Symphonia decoding; `src/storage/` stores settings and metadata cache records in SQLite.
